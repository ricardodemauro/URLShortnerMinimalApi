# URL Shortner with Minimal Api approach in .NET 6

> One of the new features of .NET 6 is the arrival of a new template, which will replace the default and bring a good reduction in code writing. Including the removal of the Startup.cs file.

> .NET 6 was released as LTS (long-term stable) which means support for 3 years. So we have to learn about this new baby. Don't forget new C# 10 features as well.
